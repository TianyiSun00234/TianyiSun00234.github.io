title: About me

---

I am a senior undergraduate student, major in Mathematics and minor in Computer Science and Statistics at the [University of Minnesota- Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/) in the [School of Mathematics](https://math.umn.edu/), advised by Prof.[Maria Gini](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~gini/) in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.umn.edu/cs). 

I am an independent researcher in Prof. Maria Gini's Chatbot Group. I am also in Ecolab-UMN collaboration led by Jimmy Broomfield, where I am in Jimmy Broomfield's competition best team and Sarah Milstein's COVID-19 research group. Previously, I interned at CenterPoint Energy as a data analyst supervised by Tengran Liu.

My **research interests** lie in applying mathematics in machine learning, particularly in deep learning, unsupervised learning, statistical modeling as well as their applications in natural language understanding, natural language generation and sequential decision making. I am also interested in applying AI techniques to address societal challenges, such as COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, I'm engaging in constructing interpretable, knowledge-driven system by apply mathematical reasoning in language pretraining model. I am passionate about choreographing Latin Dance, I am thinking about how to use machine learning in choreography. 

**Latin Dance** is a part of my life. I have practiced for fifteen years. I passed the golden level test and anually participated in latin dance competitions. In spring 2019, I participated in [NCDC](https://usadancencdc.org/) in Chicago and [Dance Fest](http://udancefest.com/) in St. Paul, Minneapolis. Now I am open to find a partner to make more competitions in the future!

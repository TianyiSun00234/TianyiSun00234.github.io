title: About me

---

I am currently a senior undergraduate student in the [School of Mathematics](https://math.umn.edu/) at the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), major in Mathematics and minor in Computer Science and Statistics, advised by Prof.[Maria Gini](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~gini/) in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.umn.edu/cs). 

I interned at CenterPoint Energy as a data analyst supervised by TengranLiu. I am in Ecolab-UMN collaboration hold by Jimmy Broomfield in which I am in Jimmy Broomfield's competition team and Sarah Milstein's COVID-19 project group. I am also an independent researcher in Prof. Maria Gini's Chatbot Group.

My **research interests** lie in applying mathematics in machine learning, particularly in deep learning, unsupervised learning, statistical modeling as well as their applications in natural language processing, and sequential decision making. I am also interested in applying AI techniques to address societal challenges, such as COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, I'm investigating to apply mathematical reasoning in Natural Language Understanding.

**Latin Dance** is a part of my life. I have practiced for twelve years. I passed the golden level exam (the higherst for amateur) and anually participated in latin dance competitions. In spring 2019, I participated in [NCDC](https://usadancencdc.org/) in Chicago and [Dance Fest](http://udancefest.com/) in St. Paul, Minneapolis. Now I am open to find a partner to make more competitions in the future!

title: About me

---

I am an Undergraduate student in the [School of Mathematics](https://math.umn.edu/) at the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), advised by Prof.[Maria Gini](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~gini/). 

I interned at CenterPoint Energy supervised by TengranLiu. I'm also in the Ecolab - UMN Collaboration 


My **research interests** lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in deep learning, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, statistical modeling as well as their applications in natural language processing, and sequential decision making. I am also interested in applying AI techniques to address societal challenges, such as COVID-19 pandemic.

I love **Latin Dance**. I have been dancing for twelve years. I passed the golden level exam in Beijing and anually participated in latindance competitions when I was young. Recently in spring 2019, I participated in [NCDC](https://usadancencdc.org/) in Chicago and [Dance Fest](http://udancefest.com/) in St. Paul, Minneapolis. Now I am open to find a partner to make more competitions in the future!

title: About me

---

I am a senior undergraduate student, major in Mathematics and minor in Computer Science and Statistics at the [University of Minnesota- Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/) in the [School of Mathematics](https://math.umn.edu/), advised by Prof.[Maria Gini](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~gini/) in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.umn.edu/cs). 

I am an independent researcher in Prof. Maria Gini's Chatbot Group. I am also in Ecolab-UMN collaboration led by Jimmy Broomfield, where I am in Jimmy Broomfield's competition best team and Sarah Milstein's COVID-19 research group. Previously, I interned at CenterPoint Energy as a data analyst supervised by Tengran Liu.

My **research interests** lie in applying mathematics in machine learning, particularly in deep learning and unsupervised learning as well as their applications in sequential decision making, meta-learning, and natural language understanding. I am also interested in applying AI techniques to address societal challenges, such as COVID-19 pandemic.

**International Latin Dance** is a part of my life. Fifteen years' training makes me more passionate, energetic, and persistent. I received the Gold Medal Certificate in 2012, the third place in 2012 Asia Ballroom Dance Federation, and second place in both [2020 National Collegiate DanceSport Championships](https://usadancencdc.org/) in Chicago and [2020 Dance Fest](http://udancefest.com/) in St. Paul, Minneapolis.

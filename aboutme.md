title: About me

---

I am a senior undergraduate student, major in Mathematics and minor in Computer Science and Statistics at the [University of Minnesota- Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/) in the [School of Mathematics](https://math.umn.edu/), advised by Prof.[Maria Gini](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~gini/) in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.umn.edu/cs). 

I am an independent researcher in Prof. Maria Gini's Chatbot Group. I am also in Ecolab-UMN collaboration led by Jimmy Broomfield, where I am in Jimmy Broomfield's competition best team and Sarah Milstein's COVID-19 research group. Previously, I interned at CenterPoint Energy as a data analyst supervised by Tengran Liu.

My **research interests** lie in the general area of AI, particularly in machine learning, deep learning, unsupervised learning, Bayesian deep learning, and Meta-Learning, as well as their applications in sequential decision making and natural language understanding. I am also interested in applying AI techniques to address societal challenges, e.g., educational inequality and COVID-19 pandemic.

**International Latin Dance** is a part of my life. Fifteen years' training makes me more passionate, energetic, and persistent. I received the [Gold Medal Certificate](assets/img/gold.jpg) from China Ballroom Dance Federation, the third place in [2012 Asia Ballroom Dance Federation](assets/img/abdf2.jpg) in Beijing, second place in both 2019 National Collegiate DanceSport Championships in Chicago and 2019 Dance Fest in St. Paul, Minneapolis.

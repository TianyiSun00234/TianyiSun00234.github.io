I am an incoming Graduate student in the [Computational and Applied Mathematics](https://cam.uchicago.edu/) program, at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/).

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics (Computer Specialization) and a minor in Statistics at the [University of Minnesota Twin - Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). 

I was an undergraduate researcher advised by Prof. [Maria Gini](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~gini/) and worked with Prof. [karel Prikry](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_Prikry) on [senior capstone project]() and Prof. [Gilad Lerman](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~lerman/) on [MUDAC](http://www.mudac.org/mankato/). I was in Ecolab-UMN collaboration led by Jimmy Broomfield, where I am in Jimmy Broomfield's forecasting best team and Sarah Milstein's COVID-19 research group. Previously, I interned at CenterPoint Energy as a data analyst supervised by Tengran Liu.

My **research interests** lie in the general area of AI, particularly in machine learning, unsupervised learning, Bayesian deep learning, and Meta-Learning, as well as their applications in sequential decision making and natural language understanding. I am also interested in applying mathematical modeling and HCI to address societal challenges, e.g., COVID-19 pandemic.

**International Latin Dance** is a part of my life. Fifteen years' training makes me more passionate, energetic, and persistent. I received the [Gold Medal Certificate](assets/img/gold.jpg) from China Ballroom Dance Federation, the [third place in the Fifth International Standard Dance Championship](assets/img/abdf2.jpg) from Asia Ballroom Dance Federation in Beijing, second place in both 2019 National Collegiate DanceSport Championships in Chicago and 2019 Dance Fest in St. Paul, Minneapolis.

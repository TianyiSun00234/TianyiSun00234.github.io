title: About me

---

I am an Undergraduate student in the [School of Mathematics](https://math.umn.edu/) at the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), advised by Prof.[Maria Gini](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~gini/). 

I interned at CenterPoint Energy as a data analyst supervised by TengranLiu. After that I joined a collaboration between Ecolab and UMN (Ecolab-UMN) leaded by Jimmy Broomfield that is conducting a series of research projects focused on COVID-19. In which I am a member in the competition team lead by Jimmy Broomfield and also a member in Sarah Milstein's COVID-19 projects group. During which we did several competitions, modeling challenges and research projects. I am also a member in Prof.Maria Gini's Chatbot Group, where I am an undergraduate researcher doing research in NLP. 

My **research interests** lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in deep learning, unsupervised learning, statistical modeling as well as their applications in natural language processing, and sequential decision making. I am also interested in applying AI techniques to address societal challenges, such as COVID-19 pandemic. I am also interested in applying mathematics in machine learning. Recently, I'm investigating applying mathematical reasoning in natural language understanding.

I love **Latin Dance**. I have been dancing for twelve years. I passed the golden level exam in Beijing and anually participated in latindance competitions when I was young. Recently in spring 2019, I participated in [NCDC](https://usadancencdc.org/) in Chicago and [Dance Fest](http://udancefest.com/) in St. Paul, Minneapolis. Now I am open to find a partner to make more competitions in the future!

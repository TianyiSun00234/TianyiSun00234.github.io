**Dancing coordinator**
During my second semester of studying at the UMNTC, I was a dancing coordinator in the International Latin Dance Club. My work was leading the introductory and advanced class to practice what we have learned from the dancing instructors. I did enjoy my times while mentoring my peers and did not hesitate to share my competition and training experiences with them. In my personal view, practice is the most important part for dancing. To make sure all the students can get the hang of it, I spent most of my spare time correcting their detailed behaviors and guiding them dance over and over again in order to form muscle memory. Later, we successfully demonstrated our abilities in the Chicago National Collegiate DanceSport Championship and St. Paul Dance Fest.


**Volunteer English teacher** in Galle, Sir Lanka.
Additionally, I used to be a volunteer English teacher in Galle, Sri Lanka and Beijing No.2 primary school. I mainly took charge of teaching children under twelfth grade. To let these children learn more knowledge and arouse their interests in English with a limited time, I designed a specific teaching material based the character of children under twelfth and adjusted the teaching material accordingly based on the class effect that children gave back to me. When they made any progress, I would encourage and praise them to give them the sense of accomplishment. Different from mentoring peers, I need to be more patient for children and try to find their potential and inspire their own potential.

**Dancing coordinator** in International Latin Dance Club at UMN-TC.

I was leading the introductory and advanced class to practice what we have learned from the dancing instructors. In my personal view, practice is the most important part for dancing. To make sure all peers can get the hang of it, I spent most of my spare time correcting their detailed behaviors and guiding them to dance over and over again in order to form muscle memory. In Spring 2020, we successfully demonstrated our abilities in the National Collegiate DanceSport Championship in Chicago and Dance Fest at St. Paul, Minneapolis.


**Volunteer English teacher** in Galle, Sir Lanka and Beijing No.2 primary school.

I found they have common difficulties in speaking and writing. For speaking, one reason is they are weak in pronunciation, the other, along with that for writing, is lack of grammar knowledge and useful expressions. I designed a specific teaching material based on their cognitive rules. First, I broke their wrong prunciations down into single phonetic simples to correct, then guided them to consolidate their corrected ones by repeating until they have muscle memory. Second, I taught grammar and syntax use, then let them recite five pieces of useful expressions and write three sentences every day. I often adjusted my teaching according to their feedbacks, designing stimulating practice to inspire interest, encouraging and praising to find their potential. Gradually, they are motivated by not only their interests in class but also their improvements on speaking and writing abilities.
